# FF-ANN-genetic-training
This is the code in  to create a feed forward neural network, and training that by genetic algorithm.
I wrote this code as part of a project which because of high dimensionality of the features, BP and other conventional ANN training algorithms were not so effective. It turned out genetic algorithm did much better than the others.
